# Cuphead | The minigame

This is the first project at *ironhack* web development **bootcamp**, build a functional videogame that can be runned in a web browser and my first time as a full stack developer as well. Everything has been built in seven days ⏳

## The game 🎮

Do you ever tried to play the original Cuphead videogame? Difficult uh? 💢

So this is your time! 🥳  

In this mini game try to get 400 of score against Cagney carnation in the Floral Fury level to win!🌼

❗️Be careful with the acorns!❗️

🍀 It's easy!🍀 


Click start to play the game, use arrow left ← to go backwards, arrow right → to go forwards
and the spacebar to jump.

You can put the sound on and off as you please 🔇
